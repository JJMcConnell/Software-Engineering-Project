# Project Description: 
##### An online calendar application, as requested by Dr. Pickeral, the director of operations of the UF School of Music. The web application should be able to show a schedule of all music department functions for any given day, and faculty members should be able to request a block on the schedule. Each request should go to Dr. Pickeral for his approval, and if approved it should be added to the schedule.
